Semantic Workbench - ChangeLog

=========================================================================
2010-09-01, v 1.1

Upgraded prepackaged Pellet library to 2.8.1 which fixed an issue with 
the OWL reasoner throwing a ConcurrentModificationException

Added several features:

File|Save Assertions Text
Allows the text in the assertions text area to be written to a file.  
This allows a set of assertions that contain an error and cannot be 
used to generate a model to be saved to a file.

File|Save Model
Was previously File|Save.  Saves the current model to a file.

Edit|Insert Prefixes
Inserts comon prefixes (for RDF/XML, N3, Turtle) in the assertions text 
area or (for SPARQL) in the SPARQL Query text area.

Help|About
Displays verson information for the program as well as the loaded 
Jena and Pellet libraries.
